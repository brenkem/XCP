# SeednKey
The SeedNKey calculations in the XCP Standard needs to be handled in a separate library
to be interchangeable and secret for every system.

## Example
A example of a LINUX SeedNKey library including the build system (make) can be found
in the ASAM MCD-1 XCP document (https://www.asam.net/) beside the specifications.
